# The Mystical 8-Ball

This project is about exploring the use of generative AI to create a magic 8 ball website. More specifically, we want to explore its limitations in creating quality code with real empathy for users. AI tools used on this project include LLM's, image generation, and sound generation tools.

Our team will aim to understand weaknesses in the code provided from the prospective of a software *engineer*, rather than just a programmer.

Our team members are:
- Adarsh Patel
- Albert Ding
- Zed Siyed
- Christian Sulaiman
- Sam Wong
- Larry Mei
- Parth Patel
- Korey Ray
- Salam Aboul Hosn
